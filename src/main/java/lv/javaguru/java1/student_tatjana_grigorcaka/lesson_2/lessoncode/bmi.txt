What is body mass index (BMI)?

The body mass index (BMI) is a measure that uses your height and weight to work out if your weight is healthy.
Body mass index (BMI) is calculated from your weight and height.

The formula is BMI = kg/m2 where kg is a person's weight in kilograms and m2 is their height in metres squared.

For adults, the BMI ranges and classifications are:

BMI under 18.5: underweight
BMI between 18.5 and 24.9: healthy weight range
BMI between 25.0 and 29.9: overweight
BMI equal to 30.0 or above: obese
